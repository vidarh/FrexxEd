Okay! I got the fucker! :)

I've been looking for this shit kicker for months now; I thought it was a
problem with CompleteWord when compiled. It is not. The problem is in the
BookMark script.

To generate the bug:

Compile BookMark and CompleteWord and load them in the user.fpl file.
Now try to complete a word like:


   skod

   sko
      ^ I get the error when pressing A-/ at this spot (Try it! :)

The error reads: 

Identifier not found: "" error!
Line 0 of "DH1:..../CompleteWord.FPL"

The script works fine in native form.

Libraries used:

fpl.library     14.10, located at (base) 0x081900EC
frexxed.library  6.89, located at (base) 0x081D3AA8

fplc             0.36


If the hooks in bookmark:

{ // Hook functions which may affect mark positions
  Hook("BlockPaste","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");
  Hook("BlockCut","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");
  Hook("Delete","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");
  Hook("DeleteLine","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");
  Hook("DeleteWord","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");
  Hook("Backspace","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");
  Hook("BackspaceWord","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");
  Hook("Output","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");
  Hook("Yank","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");
  Hook("InsertFile","markHook();","mark_adjust_marks");

  HookPast("BlockPaste","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");
  HookPast("BlockCut","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");
  HookPast("Delete","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");
  HookPast("DeleteLine","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");
  HookPast("DeleteWord","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");
  HookPast("Backspace","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");
  HookPast("BackspaceWord","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");
  HookPast("Output","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");
  HookPast("Yank","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");
  HookPast("InsertFile","markHookPast();","mark_adjust_marks");


  HookPast("Save","saveBookMarks();","mark_save_marks");
  HookPast("Load","loadBookMarks();","mark_save_marks");
}

... are removed, the bug does not occur. Perhaps there is a problem with
hooks and compiled code?

Hope you nail this fucker soon.
