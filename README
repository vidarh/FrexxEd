DESCRIPTION

	FrexxEd is probably the most configurable/programmable text editor
	made for the Amiga.

	The main mission with FrexxEd has been to create an editor which is
	capable of doing whatever *YOU* want it to. To enable *very* much
	reprogramming/configuration for those who feel the need.

	Some of FrexxEd's features are:

	o Any amount of windows or screens (on any public screen)
	o Context-sensitive colouring/styling of text.
	o Any amount of views available in all windows.
	o Ability to edit the same file in all windows and views, or in none
	  is selected.
	o 100% recursive undo, changeable undobuffer size and on/off toggle
	o unlimited number of buffers/blocks/macros in memory
	o unlimited line lengths and buffer sizes
	o 100% programmable, everything can be done by a script instead of
	  interactive
	o *very* C-like programming language (FPL)
	o FPL compiler included, greatly enhances the script execution speed
	o clipboard support, export to/import from any unit
	o V39 aware, uses V39 functions when available
	o file name extension aware icon usage
	o easy macro record/edit/view/play/save/load
	o customizeable look of any ASCII character (to i.e enable the inverse
	  CED-look or the \xxx Emacs-look or...)
	o programmable keyassigns, make any key do anything
	o programmable mouseactions, make any mouse action perform whatever
	  you want it to
	o rectangular/column style block marks and block pastes
	o programmable menustrip, make it contain whatever you please!
	o supports XPK and PowerPacker compression/decompression and
	  encryption/decryption.
	o >600K documentation in amigaguide format
	o ARexx port, capable of reading and writing ARexx variables!
	o A *LOT* of additional scripts that perform a multitude of different
	  things. From mousedragging-style blockmarking, archive-flag removal
	  when saving, center line, binary editor, snake game, incremental
	  search, interactive C indenting and word wrap to generic assembler
	  filters, bookmarks, backup, autosave and programs that easy
	  interfaces RCS...
	o binary loading/editing/saving and true TABs
	o font sensitive GUI
	o ability to replace/change the workings of any internal function
	  through an advanced hooking procedure
	o mailing list and other eletronic mail support
