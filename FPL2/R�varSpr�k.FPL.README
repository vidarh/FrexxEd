FUNCTION
  The swedish author of childrens' books, Astrid Lindgren, presented once
upon the time a "secret language" that only the members of the "secret club"
knew how to speak! It was built by doubling every consonant in all words and
insert a. 'o' between them. That would make the word 'short' to become
'soshohorortot'.

  This little file converts all characters in FrexxEd to this 'RövarSpråk'!!!
