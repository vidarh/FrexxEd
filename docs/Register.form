                  -=*( FrexxEd v2 REGISTER FORM )*=-        (updated 96-Aug-4)

Yes! I really would like to register as a user of FrexxEd version 2! I do this
by sending you the proper amount of money (see below for different currencies)
and filling out this form! A personal keyfile and the latest FrexxEd package
will be sent to me as soon as possible! I will then be able to use all coming
updates to FrexxEd version 2 as a registered user.

(I'm aware that I have to accept a two-four weeks delivery time depending on
your current work-load.)
